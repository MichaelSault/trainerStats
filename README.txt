I've always used a combination of Google Sheets and Pokéassistant to track my progression in the game.

A few years ago I noticed Pokéassistant stopped getting regular updates.

Recently, I figured, why don't I just build myself a better solution?

Accounts aren't currently implemented, but that's the next step.
